We will be using Terraform tool for managing the infra as code. As it is easy to configure and has version control and can provision multi tenant(cloud) resources 
Prerequisites:
Terroform should be installed and ready to operate along with AWS-CLI configured on the host machine
Details:
the ec2.tf will be having code to provision n number of ec2 instances with t2.nano model. The parameters(number of instances/VPC/Subnet etc) are configurable.
The script basically spin the (default count2) n number of instances and also while creating the instances
it will add mon-scripts/crontab  to send Memory utilization of ec2 instance to Cloudwatch.
We are using cloud watch features to alert users on the CPU and Memory threshold values.
Since memory utilization cannot be sent to cloudwatch, we are installing mon-scripts to send memory metrics to Cloudwatch
alarms.tf file will be used to send SNS notifications in case of outages.

We can include AWS auto scaling feature for spinning up ec2 instances using these cloudwatch metrics in case of outages(not covered)

About the Dash board, we can use the cloud watch console or make use of any monitoring tool like Nagios/new relic (not inculded in the scripts).
